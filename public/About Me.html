    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>The most important thing you need to know about me is that I am predominantly “Sunshine Yellow” on the Insights Discovery methodology; a psychometric tool based on the psychology of Carl Jung. This basically means that I possess an innate ability to forge meaningful relationships and I tend to dive headfirst into thrilling challenges, daring escapades, and unforgettable moments.</p>
    <p>While this sounds like a world of unicorns and rainbows – and 91.5% if the time it is – I spent my last 10 years working in an extremely fast passed and utterly demanding environment – thank goodness this journey was encompassed with some of the most incredible and inspiring mentors and leaders I have ever met!</p>
    <p>To give some background to my time at this “fast passed” environment, which is literally called “Fast moving consumer goods” – I started in my early days as a regional sales representative for the company, where my focus and purpose was to form and maintain relationships with retailers and all role players whilst ensuring that our products uphold world class standards on shelf and growing in revenue.</p>
    <p>I quickly excelled in the industry and a mere 4 years later I found myself -flourishing- at the “mothership” of the company in an unfamiliar town. Wow, did I underestimate the responsibility and energy that goes into getting a product from farm to fork! My days were sometimes made up of 16 working hours a day, travelling an average of 1600 miles per month (This is a fact and is based on my Google timeline from Jan2019-June2023.) while growing my account from €4 million turnover to a whooping €22.5 million turnover in 5 years.</p>
    <p>It sure has been a crazy and unforgivingly challenging experience, where I learned skills and met people that carved out my true genius. I realized my capabilities stretch as far as I want them to, and I am constantly thriving to push my own boundaries both professionally and personally.</p>
    <p>I will forever be on a journey, seeking for new and unforgettable experiences to share with the world. You can learn more about my hobbies

    <p>While I write this bio, and the reason for me doing this is because I officially resigned from my 10 years in corporate. I’ve had this burning desire to be able to create freely - without limits, but within my own control and morale. It is for this reason that I’ve decided to embark on my adventure as a freelance Full Stack Web Developer and Digital Marketing entrepreneur. I aspire to inspire through creating beautiful things with beautiful people, and I would love to work with you!</p>
    <p>Thank you for reading my short story. I hope you enjoyed it,</p>
    <p>and I wish you well.</p>
